# Java Design Patterns [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mguilherme/java-design-patterns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mguilherme/java-design-patterns)

### Types

* **Creational Patterns**  
    Provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic.
* **Structural Patterns**  
    This design patterns concerns class and object composition. 
* **Behavioral Patterns**  
    Specifically concerned with communication between objects.
* **J2EE Patterns**  
    Concern with presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
    
#### Factory Pattern
In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

#### Abstract Factory Pattern
Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

#### Singleton Pattern
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only a single object gets created.
